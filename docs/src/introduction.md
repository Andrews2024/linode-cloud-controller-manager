# Introduction

The Linode Cloud Controller Manager (CCM) is a crucial component that integrates Kubernetes with Linode's infrastructure services. It implements the cloud-controller-manager binary, running cloud-specific control loops that are essential for cluster operation.

## What is a Cloud Controller Manager?

A Cloud Controller Manager (CCM) is a Kubernetes control plane component that embeds cloud-specific control logic. It lets you link your cluster to your cloud provider's API, separating out the components that interact with that cloud platform from components that only interact with your cluster.

## Core Functions

### Node Controller
The Node Controller is responsible for:
- Initializing node configuration with Linode-specific information
  - Setting node addresses (public/private IPs)
  - Labeling nodes with region/zone information
  - Configuring node hostnames
- Monitoring node health and lifecycle
  - Detecting node termination
  - Updating node status
  - Managing node cleanup

### Service Controller
The Service Controller manages the lifecycle of cloud load balancers:
- Manages LoadBalancer service implementations using Linode NodeBalancers
  - Creates and configures NodeBalancers
  - Updates backend pools
  - Manages SSL/TLS certificates
- Handles automatic provisioning and configuration
  - Health checks
  - Session affinity
  - Protocol configuration
- Supports multiple load balancing approaches
  - Traditional NodeBalancer deployment
  - BGP-based IP sharing for cost optimization
  - Custom firewall rules and security configurations

### Route Controller
The Route Controller configures networking for pod communication:
- Manages VPC and private network integration
  - Configures routes for pod CIDR ranges
  - Handles cross-node pod communication
- Ensures proper network connectivity
  - Sets up pod-to-pod networking
  - Manages network policies
  - Configures network routes for optimal communication

## Architecture

### Component Integration
The CCM runs as a Kubernetes deployment in your cluster and:
- Watches for changes to Service and Node resources
- Interacts with Linode's API to manage infrastructure
- Maintains state synchronization between Kubernetes and Linode resources
- Operates independently of core Kubernetes controllers
